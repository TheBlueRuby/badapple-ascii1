# Bad Apple - Ascii & Rust

I made Bad Apple with Rust by streaming from a png folder, now it's time to make it straight into a terminal.  
Inspired by [Chion82](https://github.com/Chion82/)'s [Python script to play Bad Apple in the terminal](https://github.com/Chion82/ASCII_bad_apple/), but with Rust to make it go zoom.  
ascii.txt from Chion82's repo.
